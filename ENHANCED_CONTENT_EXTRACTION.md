# Enhanced Content Extraction Update

## 🎯 Issue Addressed

The original UCalgary Anki Converter was missing important background information from cards that contained:

- Tables and data grids
- Images and diagrams
- Lists and formatted content
- Charts, graphs, and visual elements
- Additional context in solution containers

**Problem:** The script only extracted plain text from `<p>` tags in `div.container.card div.block.group p`, missing rich content in other HTML elements.

**Example URLs that had missing content:**

- https://cards.ucalgary.ca/card/17633120
- https://cards.ucalgary.ca/card/17633130

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### New Function: `extract_comprehensive_background(driver)`

Enhanced the content extraction to capture:

1. **📋 Tables** - Preserved with HTML formatting and styling
2. **🖼️ Images** - Including src URLs, alt text, and proper sizing
3. **📝 Lists** - Bullet points and numbered lists with HTML structure
4. **📊 Charts/Graphs** - Canvas elements and SVG diagrams
5. **🎨 Rich Text** - Formatted content with emphasis, styles, etc.
6. **📂 Additional Containers** - Content from `#workspace > div.solution.container > div`
7. **🔗 Embedded Content** - iframes and external resources

### Technical Implementation

#### Multiple Extraction Methods:

**Method 1: Enhanced Card Container Extraction**

- Targets: `body > div > div.container.card` and `div.container.card`
- Extracts from: `div.block.group` elements
- Captures: tables, images, lists, paragraphs, formatted divs

**Method 2: Solution Container Extraction**

- Targets: `#workspace > div.solution.container > div`
- Extracts: Additional tables, images, context not in main card area
- Skips: Form elements (questions/answers)

**Method 3: Special Content Detection**

- Targets: `canvas`, `iframe`, `svg` elements
- Captures: Charts, graphs, embedded content, diagrams

#### Content Processing Features:

- **HTML Preservation** - Maintains formatting for Anki compatibility
- **Image URL Conversion** - Makes relative URLs absolute
- **Duplicate Removal** - Prevents repeated content
- **Content Validation** - Only includes substantial content (>10 chars)
- **Anki Optimization** - Proper HTML spacing and structure

### Debug Features Added

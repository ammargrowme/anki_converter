## Troubleshooting

**üÜò Need Help? Start Here:**

### First Steps When Something Goes Wrong

1. **Try the automatic setup script first:**

   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   It fixes most common issues automatically!

2. **Check the error message** - it usually tells you exactly what's wrong

3. **Make sure you can log into cards.ucalgary.ca manually** in your browser first

### Common Issues for Beginners

**‚ùå "Command not found" or "python is not recognized"**

```bash
# Solution: Install Python first
# Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/
# Download and install, then try again
```

**‚ùå "Permission denied" (Mac/Linux)**

```bash
# Solution: Make the script executable
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

**‚ùå "Cannot find Chrome or ChromeDriver"**

- **Solution:** Install Google Chrome from https://www.google.com/chrome/
- The script handles ChromeDriver automatically

**‚ùå "Login failed"**

- ‚úÖ Check your UCalgary email and password work on cards.ucalgary.ca manually
- ‚úÖ Make sure you don't have 2-factor authentication blocking
- ‚úÖ Delete saved credentials: remove file `~/.uc_anki_config.json` and try again

**‚ùå "No cards to export" or "Access denied"**

- ‚úÖ Make sure you're enrolled in the course for that deck
- ‚úÖ Copy the URL from your browser address bar while logged into Cards
- ‚úÖ Try both detail and printdeck URL formats

**‚ùå Module/Package Errors**

```bash
# Solution: Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```

### Advanced Troubleshooting

**See what the browser is doing (Debug Mode):**

1. Open `export_ucalgary_anki.py` in a text editor
2. Find the line with `--headless` (around line 73)
3. Add a `#` at the start: `# opts.add_argument("--headless")`
4. Run the script - you'll see Chrome open and can watch what happens

**Reset Everything:**

```bash
# Delete saved credentials
rm ~/.uc_anki_config.json

# Delete virtual environment
rm -rf .venv

# Re-run setup
./setup.sh
```

**Check Your Setup:**

```bash
# Verify Python version (needs 3.8+)
python --version

# Verify pip works
pip --version

# Test if Chrome is installed
google-chrome --version  # Linux
"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" --version  # Mac
```
